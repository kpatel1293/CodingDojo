// Only Keep the Last Few

// Stan learned something today: that reducing an arrayâ€™s .length immediately shortens
// it by that amount. Given array arr and number X, remove all except the last X elements,
// and return arr (changed and shorter). Given ([2,4,6,8,10],3), change the given array to [6,8,10]
// and return it.

function lastFew(arr, num)
{
    arr.reverse().splice(num);

    return arr.reverse();
}

console.log(lastFew([2,4,6,8,10],3)); //[6,8,10]
