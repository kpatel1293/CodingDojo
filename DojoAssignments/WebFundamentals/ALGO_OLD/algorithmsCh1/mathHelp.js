// Math Help
// Cartman doesn’t really like math class and needs help. 
// You are given two numbers – the coefficients M and B in the equation Y = MX + B. 
// Build a function that returns the X-intercept 
// (Cartman’s older cousin Charlie wisely reminds him 
// that X-intercept is the value of X where Y equals zero, but he just scoffs).

function mathHelp(M, B)
{
    return (-B)/M;
}

console.log(mathHelp(-2,23));
