// Soaring IQ
// Your time with us will definitely make you smarter! Let’s say a new Dojo student, 
// Bogdan, entered with a modest IQ of 101. How smart would Bogdan be at the end of the bootcamp, 
// if his IQ rose by .01 on the first day, then went up by an additional .02 on the second day,
// up by .03 more on the third day, etc…. all the way until increasing by .98 on his 98th day
// (the end of 14 full weeks)?

function soaringIQ(iq)
{
    var num = .01;
    for(var i = 0; i < 98; i++)
    {
        iq += num;
        num += .01;
    }

    return iq;
}

console.log(soaringIQ(102));
