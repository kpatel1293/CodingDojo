// Clock Hand Angles

// Create function clockHandAngles(seconds) that,
// given the number of seconds since 12:00:00, will print the
// angles (in degrees) of the hour, minute and second hands.
// As a quick review, there are 360 degrees in a full rotation.

// Examples:

// Given clockHandAngles(3600) (equivalent to 1:00:00),
// print "Hour Hand: 30 degs. Minute Hand: 0 degs.
// Second Hand: 0 degs.".

// For an input parameter seconds of 119730
// (equivalent to 9:15:30 plus 24 hrs!), you should log
// "Hour Hand: 277.75 degs. Minute Hand: 93 degs.
// Second Hand: 180 degs.".

// Note: in the second example,
// the angle for the minute hand is not simply 90 degrees;
// it has advanced a bit further, because of the additional
// 30 seconds in that minute so far.
