Rockin' the Dojo Sweatshirt
Ever since you arrived at the Dojo, you wanted one of those cool Coding Dojo sweatshirts - maybe even more than one. Let's say they cost $20 (including tax), but friendly Josh will give a 9% discount if you buy two, or a nice 19% discount if you buy three, or a sweet 35% discount if you buy four or more. He only accepts cash and doesn't have coins, so you have to round up to the nearest dollar. Build a function sweatshirtPricing(num) that, given how many sweatshirts you want, returns the cost.
